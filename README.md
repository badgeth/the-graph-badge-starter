# Indexer KPI Subgraph

This subgraph tracks The Graph network indexers performance.

## Local Development

- Clone graph-node repository
- `cd graph-node/docker`
- Open docker-compose.yml and edit ethereum addresses to point to alchemy.api
- `docker-compose up`
- Postgres won't start:
  - `rm -rf graph-node/docker/data/postgres; docker-compose up;`
- Pro tip:
  - Kill docker-compose often with either `CTRL+C` or `docker-compose down` so API limit not exceeded
  - `throw new Error('Stop Syncing!')` can crash the program so it stops syncing too and reduces the logs

## Metrics implemented

- Indexer Background:
  - `createdAtTimestamp`: UNIX Timestamp when the Indexer went live
  - `vesting/managedAmount`: Amount of GRT received as part of the official testnet program
  - `vesting/beneficiary`: Ethereum address of the beneficiary of the vesting contract
- Indexer Parameters
  - `ownStake`: GRT Tokens staked in the protocol by the Indexer itself
  - `delegatedStake`: GRT Tokens delegated to the Indexer
  - `allocatedStake`: GRT Tokens allocated by the Indexer in the protocol
  - `allocationRatio`: Ratio of allocated tokens versus allocation capacity
  - `maximumDelegation`: Maximum GRT Tokens that can be delegated to this Indexer before overdelegation
  - `delegationRatio`: GRT Tokens delegated to this indexer versus maximum delegation
  - `isOverDelegated`: Flag to indicate if this Indexer is overdelegated
- Delegation Parameters
  - `indexingRewardCutRatio`: Indexing Reward Cut Ratio (between 0 and 1)
  - `queryFeeCutRatio`: Query Fee Cut Ratio (between 0 and 1)
  - `parameterUpdates`: List of all parameters update
- Metrics of last 30 days (rolling period)
  - `lastMonthParametersUpdateCount`: Number of updates on the parameters over the last 30 days
  - `lastMonthDelegatorRewardRate`: Reward per GRT token delegated over the last 30 days

## Local development

The below instructions are adapted from The Graph [Quick Start Instructions](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start).

Clone the source code:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mtahon/indexer-kpi-subgraph.git
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

## Deploy to The Graph

The below commands deploy to The Graph hosted environment

Create an access token and store it locally. `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` is from The Graph Dashboard.

```shell
graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ `<ACCESS_TOKEN>`
```

Then deploy:

```shell
yarn deploy
```
